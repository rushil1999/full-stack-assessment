## Steps to run the code
1. Clone or fork the repo
2. run `npm install` in both frontend and backend
3. Go to backend, run `npm run develop`
4. In another terminal, go to frontend and run `npm run dev`
5. You can access your fronend on port 3000 and backend on port 1337


## Few points
1. I have used React external libraries for some functinalities 
   - For rich text in answers in FAQ section [react-markdown](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-markdown) has been used as the backend provides text in `[text](link)` format
   - For FAQ dropdown section, [react-faq-component](https://github.com/binodswain/react-faq-component#readme) has been used
2. Pure HTML/CSS has been used in some parts for UI
3. Comments are added in code for explanation
4. Have tried to follow best practices while writing code and tried to duplicate the original site as much as possible in the given time


## Challenges and ongoing issues
1. ENV is not working in Next.js
2. Certain CSS animations and transition are missing due to time constraint.
